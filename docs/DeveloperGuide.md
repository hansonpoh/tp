### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* `FindCommandParser` uses `MultiFieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` to use `ArgumentMultimap` to search through the contact list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The arrow from `ModelManager` to `Person` should be labeled '* filtered', and the arrow from `PersonList` to `Person` should be labeled '* all', but they look swapped due to a limitation of PlantUML.
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `PersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Duplicate checking for person
Wi-Find checks for Duplicates using email or phone number. 
- If either of these already exist in the database, they are considered duplicates. 
- Duplicate checking is checked in the Person class using the isSamePerson() method, and is handled in respective parsers by asking for confirmation.


### Find command supporting multiple variables
Find command in Wi-Find supports filtering across multiple parameters. 
- If two or more keywords of the same type of parameters are present, it works like a ‘OR’ search, displaying the contact as long as one of the keywords are present. 
- For keywords of different parameters, it works like ‘AND’ search, where the contact is displayed only when all of the conditions are satisfied across the parameters.

### Description for meetings
Description field for adding meetings are optional and limited to 50 characters.

### <code>yyyy</code> vs <code>uuuu</code> in Strict Parsing
In Java's <code>DateTimeFormatter</code>, <code>yyyy</code> represents the **year-of-era**, while <code>uuuu</code> represents the **proleptic year**.
- When using <code>ResolverStyle.STRICT</code>, <code>yyyy</code> can produce a <code>TemporalAccessor</code> that **cannot always be resolved to** <code>LocalDateTime</code>, causing parsing errors.
- <code>uuuu</code> ensures the year is interpreted in a way that <code>LocalDateTime</code> can always construct correctly, even in strict mode.
- <code>yyyy</code> is used instead of <code>uuuu</code> in documentation for easier understanding.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* contacts are from many different time zones
* contacts are also both long and short term
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app, in an organised way.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Environment Requirements
    - Should work on either Windows, Linux and macOS as long as it has Java `17`.
    - Should not depend on any remote server.
2.  Data Requirements
    - User data should be locally in a human-editable text file.
    - Data should be automatically saved after each modification to prevent accidental loss.
3.  Performance Requirements
    - On a computer meeting the minimum hardware specifications (Intel i5 10th Gen, 8 GB RAM, SSD, Windows 10 or 
      macOS 12), the system’s startup time — measured from launch command to main interface ready for input — shall not exceed 
      3 seconds in 95% of test runs.
    - Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons and 50 meetings per contact without a noticeable sluggishness (<= 200ms) in 
      performance for typical usage.
    - Search/filter operations should return results within 1 second for 1000 contacts.
4.  Usability Requirements
    - A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse (about 10% faster).
    - The system should provide clear, human-readable error messages when invalid input is given.
    - The GUI should remain usable across standard screen resolutions (≥1280x720) and scaling settings (100%, 125%, 150%).
5.  Maintainability Requirements
    - The system should follow object-oriented principles to support modularity and extensibility.
    - Code should follow the SE-EDU code style.
6.  Portability Requirements
    - The product should be packaged as a single `.jar` file (≤100 MB).
    - Application related files should not exceed 15 MB each.
7.  Reliability Requirements
    - The system should not crash under normal usage (Managing up to 1000 persons with 50 meetings each).
    - Invalid input should not cause data corruption or loss.
8.  Automatic timezone requirements
    - The system should be able to change the local time if user travels overseas based on operating system's timezone settings.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   2. Open a **command prompt** (Windows), **terminal** (Mac) or **linux terminal/ Konsole** (Linux, depending on
         your desktop environment)
   3. Go to the **home folder** you designated for Wi-Find:

      ```bash
      cd path/to/your/folder
      ```
   4. Start Wi-Find by typing:
       ```bash
      java -jar WiFind.jar
      ```
   5. Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by following the same steps [above](#launch-and-shutdown).<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Adding a person

1. Adding a person

   1. Test case: `add n/Joe Lim p/12345678 e/Joe@google.com c/Singapore com/Starbucks t/friend` <br>
      Expected: New contact created with Name: Joe Lim, Phone: 12345678, Email: Joe@google.com, Country: Singapore, Company: Starbucks, tags: [friend]

   2. Test case: `add n/Joe Lim p/12345678 e/Joe@google.com c/Singapore com/Starbucks t/friend` followed by `add n/Jacky Loh p/12345678 e/Jacky@google.com c/China com/Taobao t/supplier` <br>
      Expected: Wi-Find warns about duplicate persons already existing in the database. Enter y to confirm addition or any other input to cancel

   3. Test case: `add n/Joe Lim p/12 e/Joe@google.com c/Singapore com/Starbucks t/friend`<br>
      Expected: Wi-Find displays error message as phone number needs to be at least 3 characters long

## **Appendix B - Effort**

Team size: 5

Challenges faced: With a more narrow target audience, our project had to cater harder specific features targeted to this audience unlike AB3 which had a broad audience with basic features. We had to make sure contact information is both easy to understand and information dense to improve convenience.

What was reused:

1. AB3 Command-commandParser structure
2. AB3 Model and Model-Manager
3. AB3 Storage
4. AB3 UI design choice
5. AB3 JUnit tests unaffected by our changes

Achievements:

1. Country and Company attributes added to contacts.
2. Added correct duplicate handling, AB3 used names as unique identifiers, while we used phone numbers and email.
3. Added confirmable commands, to allow users to add duplicates, while still warning them that there already are contacts with the respective phone or email in the database.
4. Added links, flags and meetings to a contacts field.
5. Updated Find command to support searching across multiple parameters and searching by substrings.
6. Updated Add command to accept alphanumeric characters for name and email.
7. Included special prefix ‘[ prefix/]’ in CRUD commands to allow prefixes as inputs.
8. Tags and emails are now lowercase regardless of input.
9. Tags are now limited to 32 characters.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Planned Enhancements**
- Upcoming meetings listed should be sorted.
- Add more countries to timezonemapper.
- Ensure link/edit commands preserve active filters for smoother workflow.
- Implement compatibility for meetings in dd-mm-yyyy in find command instead of just dd mmm yyyy.
- Make edit only trigger duplicate detection upon editing phone or email fields
- Implement automatic conversion of meeting times into clients timezone
- Implement confirmation for ClearCommand
